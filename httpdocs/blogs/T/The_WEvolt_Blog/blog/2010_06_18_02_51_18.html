<p><span style="font-family: helvetica;">Let's talk about your MYvolt. You've probably seen your MYvolt page, but probably don't really know what it is, or what it's for.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: helvetica;">First up, this is an absolutely private page. You can't authorize any body else to see what's on it, and no one else can see your MYvolt page. This is your page to sort out your web browsing experience. I thought I'd kick it off by showing you what I've done with my MYvolt page:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: helvetica;"><img src="http://wevolt.com/blogs/T/The_WEvolt_Blog/media/MYvolt_screencap.jpg" alt="" width="551" height="548" /></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: helvetica;">Alright, so this is what I'm doing on my MYvolt page. Hopefully it will give you some ideas what you can do with yours. Let's start up the top left.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: helvetica;">EXCITE: This is the equivalent of your Facebook status, with one key difference. You have to include a link. Talk about how you're walking your dog on Facebook, but talk about what you're excited about on WEvolt. This can be published to your WEvolt page so you can let everyone know what you're excited about. It's a great way for you to contribute to marketing your favorite creator, or adding to the hype of a huge marketing campaign.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: helvetica;">Underneath the EXCITE is a huge box that is your headline scraper. Click on the little star and go to ADD FEEDS. Find the RSS feed for your favorite website and enter the URL right there. Refresh your page and BAM! It's ready to go. I've included <a href="http://www.comicbookresources.com/" target="_blank">COMICBOOKRESOURCES.COM</a> cos that's my go to place for headlines and comic news.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: helvetica;">The the right of these are four LIST BOXES.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: helvetica;">These can create manual or dynamic lists. I've created four manual lists here to show you its versatility. If I click on the drop downs I can make multiple lists for each box!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: helvetica;">So what have I got?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: helvetica;">In the top left are all my favorite webcomics that I read. When Matt joins the MYvolt to the calendar, I'm going to be able to schedule reminders for myself to go check these out. For example, I might do <a href="http://www.penny-arcade.com/comic/" target="_blank">Penny-Arcade.com</a> on the Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays the comic gets released, and then maybe <a href="http://www.giantitp.com/comics/oots0001.html" target="_blank">Order of the Stick</a> every Monday. When the calendar gets linked it's going to be like the clouds part and a ray of light shines down directly on you, and you will go, "Thankyou WEvolt!"</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: helvetica;">On the top right I've got my gloating list. It's not a very big gloating list right now. But we will upload more of my stuff soon.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: helvetica;">Looking at the bottom list you will see something called WEDDING LIST. I'm lucky enough to be getting married next May, and there's lots to do. So I'm putting every good link I find to help me do my job here. I should add the homepage for the wedding Heather made before she notices!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: helvetica;">Finally on the bottom right is a bunch of recipe blogs. I've found that I don't like to cook for myself, but I do like to cook for Heather. And I'm always trying to watch my girly figure, so I like to eat healthy. These are my "go to" blogs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: helvetica;">The point is the MYvolt page is incredibly versatile. Put in every podcast you listen to. Every blog you read. Every team's webpage you follow. ESPN headlines. Work to do lists. Reference pages for your art.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: helvetica;">Remember to always make a drop down first, or have the drop down selected that you want to edit or add items to. And if you make an entry and it doesn't appear, just hit REFRESH on your browser (or F5).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: helvetica;">Have fun!</span>
