<p>JASON SAYS:</p>
<p>WELCOME TO WEVOLT LIVE!</p>
<p>After a heady month of Beta we have launched live on an auspicious day. Webcomics giant, Zudacomics.com closed today just as we step in to fill the void. And unlike Zuda, we will not take a single percent of your ownership. You keep it all in every format, in every media throughout all time and the universe in every parallel dimension. Our goal is to give creators the best platform to create and build a fan base and then *shock!* *horror!* monetize their content too through our ad network or Pro Experience subscribers.</p>
<p>I wanna take this time to especially thank my partner in crime, comic book guru and coder extraordinaire, Matt Jacobs, for coding the beast you see before you. He's been leading the team including the super-talented Dan Kram to debug WEvolt.</p>
<p>I also wanna thank all of you who submitted bug problems to help make WEvolt more stable, stronger and better. While it's live, we continue to work tirelessly on WEvolt to make it better every day.</p>

<p>So to get you started, I made this 2.5 minute (not 104 minute!) YOUTUBE video to give you a quick overview. I will also upload it into the TUTORIALS section. Click on the image to check it out.</p>
