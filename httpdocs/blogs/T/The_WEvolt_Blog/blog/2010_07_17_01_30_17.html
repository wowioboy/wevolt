Hey Everyone,</p>
<p>Just wanted to take a second and update you on what's happening with the site. As some of you have noticed WEvolt has gone down a couple times recently. But don't panic, it won't be that way forever. It seems that we've outgrown our hardware already, hoenstly it happened a bit quicker than was planned, but that's a good problem to have, I guess.</p>
<p>SO, we will moving to a new cloud system to eliminate the problems some have been exeperiencing. We can't thank everyone enough for hanging with us on the site and spreading the word. It seems to be doing to the trick.</p>
<p>Thanks again for your patience as we iron this out.</p>
<p>Matt</p>
