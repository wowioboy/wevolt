So Jason and I have been working hard on the new design implementation which should be up very soon. I must say it looks great! We put a focus on a more intuitive UI based of all your great feedback.   Stay Tuned! We might even toss a sneak preview before it goes live.</p>
<p><br /> <strong>THE FEED:</strong> The site feed is up and running. Go check it out: <a href="../../updates.php">FEED ME</a><br /> You can now become a fan of a project or user which will subscribe you to their updates. This can also give you access to Fan only content if the creator has added any.</p>
<p><br /> There has been a lot of new comics being posted by some very talented creators/publishers.  Head over here: <a href="../../enjoy.php?t=comic&amp;sort=new">NEW COMICS</a> to see what's new. Or go to the feed.</p>
<p><br /> A few more cool things coming in the next few weeks:  <strong>WEview system:</strong> This will let fans/critics create reviews for your project to help boost your project rank.   <strong>Jobs Board: </strong> We will be launching the WEvolt jobs board soon with a couple jobs ready to unleash. This will be a great place for you to find talent for a project either as a work for hire or collaborative.</p>
