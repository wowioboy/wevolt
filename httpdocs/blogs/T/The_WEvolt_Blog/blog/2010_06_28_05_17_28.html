<p>Hey all, I hope you had some fun playing with your WEvolt pages and created some fun lists. Reply to the blog post with your WEvolt page link or your username so I can go check them out.</p>
<p>Probably the best thing about creating a tool like WEvolt is seeing what people are doing with it. And people are creating some AMAZING stuff. I'm going to spend each day highlighting a new project to show you the pages that people have been creating totally HTML free.</p>
<p>Every day Matt and I are making the CMS easier to use and look better. By July 1st, it should be pretty slick. But even with the room for improvement it can still do some pretty impressive stuff totally HTML free! This first project is a great example of that:</p>
<p><img style="float: left; margin-right: 5px; margin-left: 5px;" src="http://wevolt.com/blogs/T/The_WEvolt_Blog/media/n108180522538717_8568.jpg" alt="THE PATH by JamesRiot" /><a title="THE PATH by James Riot" href="../../The_Path/" target="_blank">THE PATH by JamesRiot</a></p>
<p>Go click on the link, it will open in a new tab. Then VOLT it so you never forget this awesomeness (open up the reader and click on the V). I guarantee you will use Jame's page as a great reference for your own design.</p>
<p>JamesRiot is an old Panel Flow veteran so he's familiar with the CMS, but I think he's taken it up another level here.</p>
<p>Talking to Matteblack we're playing with the idea of Pro's being able to change the color of the WEvolt PRO user tools on the left so they don't stand out like a sore thumb in the face of such beautiful design.</p>
<p>THE PATH's homepage is an assault of entertainment. First up, you can see that because he's a webcomic, his latest page takes precedence at the top so his current readers can see what is his prime update is.</p>
<p>There's a little Author Note up to the top right which in this case he's used to give us glimpse at what's going on behind the scenes. It's a nice little personalization and the photo helps you realize this is a real person, not a sweat shop creating all this by himself.</p>
<p>Below that is his link to Facebook which he's showcased with a beautiful piece of artwork. Click on it and it will take you to his Facebook page for the Path.</p>
<p>JamesRiot being a prolific soul has got two other comics in addition to the 13 issue epic that is THE PATH. He's throw these up here. I recommend checking them out and throwing them in the VOLT also (open up the reader and click on the V).</p>
<p>He then uses the next tier to give you his updates, news and thoughts. Here's a link to his blog and his Twitter all in one place. I do recommend checking out his blog. He does a great job of covering a lot of what's coming down the path (no pun intended) with WEvolt and why he's excited about it:</p>

<p>Being an old Panel Flow member we've extended JamesRiot some bonuses to help his readers make the transition to WEvolt. He's cleverly decided to start a contest:</p>

<p>Offering a lifetime pro subscription for the best fan art!</p>
<p>So VOLT The Path, read The Path, and get drawing!
