<p><span style="font-family: helvetica;"><span style="font-size: small;"><strong>Welcome to WEvolt beta!</strong></span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: helvetica;"><span style="font-size: small;">Matt and I are going to chime in on a daily basis and let you know all the awesome stuff that's happening on WEvolt.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: helvetica;"><span style="font-size: small;">First up, we can't thank you enough for checking out WEvolt at it's largely embryonic stage. I mentioned on the <a href="../../forum/index.php?user=wevolt&amp;a=read&amp;topic=141&amp;board=86" target="_blank">SQUASHING BUGS FORUM</a> that you guys are like Indiana Jones hacking yourself a lone path through a jungle with merely a machete. Meanwhile, Matt and I are miles behind you trying to pave a road for everyone else.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: helvetica;"><span style="font-size: small;">And that road will be paved by July 1st well ahead of Comic Con!</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: helvetica;"><span style="font-size: small;">To help us get there, and to help Matt get some sleep before then (he's seriously working 14-16 hours a day right now) it would be great if you could add any bugs to the <a href="../../forum/index.php?user=wevolt&amp;a=read&amp;topic=141&amp;board=86" target="_blank">SQUASHING BUGS FORUM</a>. Try and describe how you created the bug, and it's even better if you can post the error code you get in the forum also.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: helvetica;"><span style="font-size: small;">So what's working right now?</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: helvetica;"><span style="font-size: small;">Your MYvolt and WEvolt pages are pretty solid right now. I'm going to cover some ideas on how to use them next post.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: helvetica;"><span style="font-size: small;">WEvolt is so vast and so versatile, we don't want to tell you that you have to use it a specific way. We just want to show you some ideas, and see which ones work for you.</span></span></p>
