<p><strong>WHAT IS WEVOLT?</strong></p>
<p>This is a question that I'm getting bombarded with. And it's a fair question too, because quite frankly, there's never been anything like WEvolt.</p>
<p>At its heart, WEvolt is two things.</p>
<p>1. WEvolt is an online entertainment platform for creators. It's designed for webcomics, but I will let you in on a little secret... It works for any online media. Comic book creators, bands, poets, bloggers, professional haiku-writers, aspiring film makers, photographers and artists. It's a means to create a unique and professional online identity without knowing any html. Then you can apply for our revenue share and start monetizing all that hard work.</p>
<p>2. WEvolt is an online content aggregator and sharing tool. On your MYvolt page you can organize all your online content into categories, then schedule it all. Remind yourself to check out <a href="http://espn.go.com/" target="_blank">ESPN.com</a> or <a href="http://www.deviantart.com/" target="_blank">deviantart.com</a> every day, but maybe go check out <a href="http://www.cracked.com/" target="_blank">cracked.com</a> every Wednesday? Or vice versa, it's up to you. If you like a page, don't just bookmark it. Schedule it! Then use your WEvolt page to publish all your favorite stuff so friends can see it and check it out. Then find out what sites your friends are visiting.</p>
<p>There's so many more parts to WEvolt. Networks, forums, WEmail, the Studio as well as our WEvolutionary navigation system. Some parts are here, some parts are only partially here. I'd like to say that by July 1st it's all going to be here, but Matt and I are coming up with new ideas every day. And we'd love your ideas too. Head to the <a href="../../contact.php" target="_blank">CONTACTS</a> page and let us know what you think.</p>
<p>You can find more information about WEvolt on our <a href="../../wevolt.php" target="_blank">ABOUT</a> page. There's a cartoon strip and a little origin story.</p>
<p>In upcoming posts I'm going to be throwing you some ideas on how to use your MYvolt and WEvolt pages.</p>
<p>UPDATED: Matt just implemented my new CMS design. Go check it out, it's much cleaner and much more stable. Click on your REvolt button on the left there.</p>
