<p>I notice that the most common comments so far about WEvolt are that the interface is a little "funky."</p>
<p>I'm not here to make excuses, it absolutely is.</p>
<p>And it's funky for two reasons:</p>
<p>1. We haven't taught you how to use the designs! I just created a bunch of screencast videos to teach you how to use all the navigation tools. I'm talking to our uber-social marketing tech dude about how best to upload these.</p>
<p>2. It is just plain funky. The way Matt and I worked was that we decided that it was important to get something up there and then by using it, figure out what didn't work with it. In that instance I didn't spend a lot of time designing it. The Content Management System is a great example of that. We slapped something up that works, but it ain't pretty and as we discovered, not user-friendly. I highlighted <a href="../../The_Path/">THE PATH</a> last blog post, and that brilliance was made with our "funky" CMS.</p>
<p>But Matt and I don't expect everyone to have the same perseverance and commitment that JamesRiot does. Hell, I don't! Which is why my projects remain suspiciously empty.</p>
<p>So I've been working on a new CMS design. Here's a sneak preview of what you will see. It's clean, slick and explains every step for an incredibly user-friendly experience.</p>
<p>No, those aren't my projects, just thumbnails I used as placeholders.</p>
<p>When can you see it? Why July 1st my friends!</p>
