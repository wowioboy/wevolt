               Panel 1:

                                   JULIE
                         I met Howard Wight when I was
                         sixteen years old, Tom.    

               Panel 2:

                                   JULIE (CONT'D)
                         I was driving my friends back from
                         a party.  We'd been drinking...    
                             (link)
                         When I woke up in the hospital I
                         was told both of my friends were
                         dead.

               Panel 3:

                                   JULIE (O.S.) (CONT'D)
                         Three months of rehabilitation was
                         nothing compared to the hatred I
                         saw in the eyes of their families.

               Panel 4:

                                   JULIE (CONT'D)
                         They wanted to make an example of
                         me, to discourage kids from drunk
                         driving.  At the minimum I was
                         looking at vehicular manslaughter.  
                             (link)
                         A friend who'd had some serious
                         scrapes with the law told me about
                         a Wight & Associates...

                                   TOM
                         Julie,  is Wight buying verdicts?
                             (link)
                         But then... why would Schuster
                         settle?

               Panel 5:

                                   JULIE
                         You're not getting it, Tom.
                         Schuster didn't care about money. 
                         He just wanted his little girl
                         healthy again.
                             (link)
                         And now she's recovered from a
                         mystery ailment moments after he
                         agreed to settle.  
                             (link)
                         And I wanted the whole accident
                         thing to just go away. And it did. 
                         Another BAL test showed I had
                         barely any in my system at the time
                         of the crash.

               Panel 1:

                                   JULIE (CONT'D)
                         People come to Wight because they
                         need something and they're willing
                         to do anything to get it.
                             (link)
                         Including giving up their soul.

                                   TOM
                         That's what Miller said, that day
                         in his cell.
                             (link)
                         You're serious, right?  You're
                         telling me this is for real?  How
                         does he do it?

               Panel 2:

                                   JULIE
                         I don't think I should say.  I
                         don't know what it would mean for
                         you.

               Panel 3:

                                   TOM
                         I'm asking you to.

               Panel 4:

                                   JULIE
                         Are you sure about this?  
                             (link)
                         It's funny, that's actually the
                         last thing Wight asked me.

               Panel 5:

                                   TOM
                         I'm sure.

               NO DX.

                                   ELI
                         You disappoint me, Fell.  So
                         cliche.  I expected more from you.

               Panel 3:

                                   ELI (CONT'D)
                         You know the story of the parable
                         of the scorpion and the frog, Mr.

                                   ELI (CONT'D)
                         The scorpion's reply to the frog
                         is, 'I'm a scorpion, it's what I
                         do.'

               Panel 5:

                                   ELI (CONT'D)

                                   ZOEY
                         It's my place, why would I?

                                   ADAM
                         Right.

               Panel 2:

                                   ADAM (CONT'D)
                         So, what just happened?

                                   ZOEY
                         I had hoped it would be a little
                         more memorable than that.

               Panel 3:

                                   ADAM
                         No, it was amazing.  I just
                         meant...

                                   ZOEY
                         I know.
                             (link)
                         Like I said earlier.  We've only
                         got so much time.  

               Panel 4:

                                   ZOEY (CONT'D)

                                   ELI
                         As usual, I saw to it personally.

                                   WIGHT
                         So, you'll be going then?

               Panel 2:

                                   ELI
                         Don't blame me, Howard.  I'm just
                         the messenger. 

               Panel 3:

                                   WIGHT
                         You use my words against me?  
                             (link)
                         Well done, Eli.

               Panel 4:

                                   WIGHT (CONT'D)
                         I shouldn't have expected you to
                         pay respects to a man who just lost
                         his best friend.

               Panel 5:

                                   ELI
                         You know there's no such thing as
                         friends.  
                             (link)
                         And, if Fell let Tom and Julie get
                         away you'd be outta options.  I did
                         what had to be done. 

               Panel 6:

                                   WIGHT
                         People always do what they have to
                         do.

                                   ELI
                         But there's where you're different,
                         Howard.  You did it because you
                         wanted to, not because you had to.

               Panel 7:

               Wight has his head in his hands.

                                   ELI (O.S.) (CONT'D) 
                         Thanks for the scotch.
