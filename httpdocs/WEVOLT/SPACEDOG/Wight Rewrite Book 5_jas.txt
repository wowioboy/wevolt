                         decided advantage the other party

                         But it was your stirring words that
                         coerced her to the same deal as I
                         for far, far less...

                         In other words, you used me.

                                   WIGHT (O.S.)
                         No. I groomed you.

               Panel 5:
                         Millions would've killed to work
                         with me on that case let alone find
                         the "smoking gun".

                         I would've hoped for a little more
                         gratitude.

               Panel 6:

                                   ADAM
                         We didn't win because of me.
                         We won because Marcia Clasky
                         stacked the deck in our favor when
                         she sold her soul.  It's all
                         bullshit, smoke and mirrors.

               Panel 1:

                                   ADAM (CONT'D)
                         The only comfort I can take from
                         any of it is that YOU ARE dying,
                         which means you'll have to pay the
                         piper soon enough, burn for all the
                         people you've taken advantage of
                         and corrupted...

                         Will I now?  
                             (link)
                         It seems I've overestimated you and
                         you've underestimated me, Mr.
                         Rosen.  

               Panel 2:

                                   WIGHT (CONT'D)
                         I renegotiated my contract.  If
                         Wight & Associates collect a
                         specified number of souls, I could
                         have my own back.

               Panel 3:

                                   ADAM
                         You arrogant, self absorbed,
                         fucking asshole.  Did you ever stop
                         to consider anyone but yourself?

               Panel 4:

                                   WIGHT
                         I considered you as my replacement.
                         See, the other party is taking
                         action to make sure I fall short.
                         So I'm offering you all Wight &
                         Associates if you continue
                         collecting souls after I die. And
                         you don't even have to sell your
                         soul for it

                                   ADAM
                         I can give you my answer right
                         now... go to hell.

               Panel 5:

                                   WIGHT
                         It seems that lately that the only
                         person I can count on is myself.

               Panel 6:

                                   WIGHT (O.S.) (CONT'D)
                         Your part in the Marcia Clasky
                         arrangement has implicated you. If
                         you try to walk away... well, you
                         saw what happened to Newman and
                         Fell.

                                   ADAM
                         Are you threatening me?

                         It's not me you need worry about. 
                         He won't allow you to jeopardize my
                         plans.  At least not until I stand
                         at the brink of victory.

                         It'll be alright, Lauren.  We all
                         must be strong in the face of
                         tragedy and continue on.  It's how
                         Lucas would have wanted it.

                         know what he's doing. If you see
                         him tell him to call me!

                         over or something?

                         need to talk to Wight, do you know
                         if he's in?

               Panel 6:

                         I didn't know you smoked.

               Panel 2:
                         Thanks for coming Tom.
                         Everyone at Wight & Associates is
                         dropping, so I might as well smoke

                         you're crazy, in fact I think Wight
                         may be in cahoots with the devil.

               Panel 4:

                                   TOM
                         Right now I'm hoping either one of
                         us is crazy.

                         You understand what I'm saying,

                                   TOM
                         First just tell me everything you

                         So Wight was going to hand you the
                         keys to the kingdom if you
                         continued to find victims?

                                   ADAM
                         Yeah.  Another loophole he
                         identified, is that his
                         renegotiated deal did not specify
                         an end date with his death.

                                   TOM
                         So if he croaks, Wight & Associates
                         could continue his work till his
                         soul is released.
                         An oversight?

                         Doubtful, but Wight still thinks he
                         can use it to his advantage.

                         But she didn't realize his real
                         agenda till somebody paid her a
                         visit.

                         hers.  Even after I heard, I was
