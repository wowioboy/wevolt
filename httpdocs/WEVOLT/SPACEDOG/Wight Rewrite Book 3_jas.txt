                         I can't get my mind around it,

                         I can tell you how sorry I am for
                         hurting you, but I doubt it will
                         help.

                         Maybe because it was Adam. Maybe
                         it's just me.
                         I never planned on taking the offer
                         from Wight and leaving Chicago. I
                         figured I'd get a free trip... get
                         wined and dined. Then I met you...

                         But right now between you and Sean
                         Miller, even if the guy is off his
                         rocker...
                         This feels like Hell.
                         I made a promise to see the Spire
                         case through.

                         the courthouse to meet Mr. Fell. 
                         I'll stay here and help Arthur

                         Tom.
                         Since Adam seems to be securing his
                         next conquest on my dime, I could
                         use some good news. Tell me how
                         you've secured Spire an alibi.

               Panel 2:

                                   TOM
                         Sorry, sir.
                         Patrons at the bar saw Spire but no
                         one can say when he left.
                         Bartender says Spire left before
                         ten, but he won't swear to it.
                         Which at least keeps him out of
                         play for the prosecution.

               Panel 3:

                                   WIGHT
                         It looks like you've got your work
                         cut out for you.  Don't let me
                         down.

               Panel 4:

                                   TOM
                         I'll do my best, sir.  But --

               Panel 5:

                                   WIGHT
                         That's all I ask, Tom.

                                   SCHUSTER
                         Wait.  What if I've decided to
                         accept the offer?  What do I have
                         to do?

                                   FELL
                         As you know, in my opinion their
                         settlement offer is far from
                         equitable, but...

                         I'm talking about yours.

                                   SCHUSTER
                         I was told you could guarantee her
                         safety... for a price. 

               Panel 5:

                                   SCHUSTER (CONT'D)
                         I don't care about the money or the
                         case.  I just want her to be safe,
                         no matter what it costs.

                                   FELL
                         I see.  Well, that's a different
                         matter entirely.

                         this morning.
                         I cozied up to her assistant
                         earlier and she confirmed there's
                         something there.

               Panel 3:

                                   CAPTION (CONT'D)
                         But when the irresistible force
                         meets the immovable object, one
                         will  give.

               Panel 4:

                                   CAPTION (CONT'D)
                         Are you nervous out there, wherever
                         you are, forever trying to led men
                         into temptation?

               Panel 5:

                                   CAPTION (CONT'D)
                         Me? I don't get nervous.

               Panel 1:

                                   ADAM (O.S.)
                         You see, Tom. Some men are born
                         into greatness...

               Panel 2:

                                   ADAM (O.S.) (CONT'D)
                         And some men have greatness thrust
                         upon them.

               Panel 3:

                                   ADAM (CONT'D)
                         But I wasn't a trust fund kid and I
                         was never in the right place at the
                         right time.
                             (link)
                         My greatness is the self made kind.  

               Panel 4:

                                   ADAM (CONT'D)
                         Marcia fucked Spire.  Hell, I
                         wouldn't be surprised it she killed
                         them.

               Panel 5:

                                   ZOEY
                         She admitted this to you? 

                                   ADAM
                         After a masterful bit of prodding
                         and coaxing.

                                   JULIE
                         She loves Spire, doesn't she?  And
                         you used it to twist her arm?

               Panel 6:

                                   ADAM
                         Cut the innocent act, Jules.
                         Wight brought us in for one reason;
                         to win.  And I single-handedly just
                         did that.
                         Who's in the mood to celebrate?
                         Drinks are on me!  

                                   ZOEY
                         Two more cases in the plus column.

               Panel 6:

                                   ZOEY (CONT'D)
                         Another banner day for Wight &
                         Associates.

               Panel 1:

                                   ZOEY (CONT'D)
                         How did the old man take the news
                         when you told him?

               Panel 2:

                                   ADAM
                         Cool as a cucumber.  But he wanted
                         to confirm it with Claskey.

                                   ZOEY
                         Guess you'll be off to the Windy
                         City, Tom.

               Panel 3:

                                   JULIE
                         What's it to you, Zoey?

                                   TOM
                         What's it to you, Julie?
                             (link)
                         Sorry... It's just, I've been
                         thinking...
                             (link)
                         Wight & Associates isn't what it
                         appears to be. Sean Miller appeared
                         to me...

               Panel 4:

                                   ADAM
                         Jesus, Tom! You want to leave the
                         firm, then do it, but stop this
                         hocus-pocus bullshit!
                         You're upset because I did your job
                         and found Spire's alibi.  

               Panel 5:

                                   ADAM (CONT'D)
                         And the whole thing with Julie?
                         Just pretend to be a grown man and
                         talk to her!
                         We win two huge cases, but instead
                         of celebrating you two are just
                         bitching and moaning.

               Panel 6:

                                   TOM
                         Thanks, coach.  
                             (link)
                         I've had enough fun for tonight. 
                         I'm gonna get going.

               PAGE TWENTY ONE

               Panel 1:

               Tom is standing in the rain, waiting for his car, still lost
               in thought.

                                   JULIE (O.S.)
                         You're right about Wight and the
                         firm.

               Panel 2:

                                   TOM
                         How do you know?

               Panel 3:

                                   JULIE
                         It's dangerous to say... anything.
                         But I -- care about you.  

               Panel 4:

                                   TOM
                         But the whole thing with Adam...

               Panel 5:

                                   JULIE 
                         Is because I tried to push you
                         away. 
                         It's part of the reason I know what
                         Wight really wants from us.

               Panel 6:

                                   JULIE (CONT'D)
                         You should leave, Tom.

               Panel 7:

                                   JULIE (CONT'D)
                         Get as far away from his place,
                         from Howard Wight, from me, as you
                         can and never look back.

               Panel 8:

                                   TOM
                         Julie, in spite of what happened, I
                         can't let go of you, of us. 

               Panel 9:

                                   JULIE
                         Tom, I'm not who you think I am...
