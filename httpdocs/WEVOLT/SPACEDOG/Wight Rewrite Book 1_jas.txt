                         our associates killing themselves.

                                   TOM
                         Just some office humor, Mr. Fell.

                                   FELL
                         Not "Mr. Fell", Tom.  Lucas will do
                         fine.

                         Oh, Okay... Did you guys hear
                         Bobby Spire was just charged with
                         Murder of his wife and Mark Mackey?

                         I don't see Spire as the type.

                         Nope.  He said it's about tailoring
                         an alternate theory of the crime
                         and convincing the jury that it's

                         Howard, can I talk to you?

                                   WIGHT
                         You've never needed my permission,

                         Jesus, Miles, you look awful.

                                   NEWMAN
                         It's all...starting to wear on me.

                                   WIGHT
                         What is?

               Panel 3:

                                   NEWMAN
                         Don't be coy. I hate what we've
                         done as much as you do.

                         Neither Miller or Bobby Spire is
                         our fault.

               Panel 4:

                         You're the best liar I know,
                         Howard.  But I've seen the wizard
                         behind the curtain.

                         well for us and you know it.   This
                         will be the first and last time you
                         ever lose.  The clock's ticking and
                         you know for whom the bell tolls.

                         balcony and I'll make you a drink.

                         A drink won't bring them back.  It
                         won't erase what we've done.

               Newman standing at the balcony, looking down at the city
               below.

                                   WIGHT (O.S.)
                         In all the years I've known you, I
                         never understood how rum was your
                         drink.  It just seems so...
                         Pedestrian. 

                                   NEWMAN
                         I'm sorry about in there.  I think
                         I'm just at the end of whatever
                         rope I have left.

                         I'm sorry I dragged you and Arthur
                         into this.  But whatever Bobby
                         Spire did to his wife... That's not
                         on us.  He made that decision.

               Panel 3:

                                   NEWMAN
                         Don't you dare talk to me about
                         Arthur.

                         Stop denying this!  They're all
                         affected by what we did.

                                   WIGHT
                         I'm not.  They made their choices,
                         we made ours.

               Panel 4:

                                   NEWMAN
                         We can't renegotiate this!  There's
                         no appeals process.  This is final.

                                   WIGHT
                         I found a loophole... We can win.

                                   NEWMAN
                         Can't you see that when you're
                         holding a losing hand you don't
                         double down?!

                         But say I did.  Exactly what would
                         you have me do?

               Panel 6:

                                   NEWMAN
                         Nothing.
                             (link)
                         This is still my life even if it
                         doesn't feel that way. We all made
                         our own decisions. So there's only
                         one thing left to say.
                             (link)

                                   CAPTION (CONT'D)

                         And once you realize that, you grip
                         it even tighter, holding on for
                         dear life.

                         gone, right down to the last grain
                         of sand, it leaves you empty

                         Like I said before; the hubris of
                         youth is the regret of the old.
