               Panel 1:

                                   CAPTION
                         Doesn't seem fair that the world
                         should look this happy and
                         pristine.

                                   CAPTION (CONT'D)
                         Blood has been spilled, a man is
                         dead.  But the band plays on
                         without missing a beat.

               Panel 2:
                          It doesn't seem fair that you're
                         still here and he isn't. 
                         Especially when some of that blood
                         is on your hands.

               Panel 3:

                                   WIGHT
                         I hope with the clarity of
                         hindsight it was all worth it,
                         Miles.

               Panel 4:

                                   WIGHT (CONT'D)
                         Be seeing you.

                         Hillside Memorial Park

               Panel 2:

               Wide screen panel of the funeral -- NO DX.

               Panel 3:

               Reverse angle of the mourners feature Tom and Julie -- NO DX.

                                   RABBI (O.S.)
                         Everyone is invited to stop by Mr.
                         Newman's home where the family will
                         be sitting shiva.

                         Tom... What do you think it means
                         that he's not here?

                                   TOM
                          Hmmm...

               Panel 5:

                                   TOM (CONT'D)
                         Your guess is as good as mine,
                         Zoey.  They knew each other a long
                         time...
                         After losing such a close friend I
                         imagine Wight needs to mourn in his
                         own way.

                         Julie, who is that talking to Fell?

                                   JULIE
                         It's Arthur Schuster.  He's a
                         client.
                         And my guess is, they are talking
                         about his case -- at a funeral. 

               Panel 2:

                                   JULIE (CONT'D)
                         Miles Newman was just laid to rest
                         and yet it's business as usual for
                         the firm.  
                         I never saw such coldness till I
                         came here.

                                   ZOEY (O.S.)
                         I doubt any of these people knew
                         Mr. Newman any better than we did.

               Panel 3:

                                   FELL
                         Ladies.
                         I've just had a chat with Mr.
                         Schuster.  He knew Miles, and now
                         finds himself without counsel for
                         his civil suit.
                         I recommended the two of you.

               Panel 4:

                                   ZOEY
                         Thank you, Mr. Fell.

                                   FELL
                         I'll meet you at Cedars tomorrow at
                         2pm sharp.  Room 3013.

               Panel 5:

                                   ZOEY
                         I can't believe Fell assigned us to
                         a senior partner's case.

                                   ADAM
                         Did you two just strike pay dirt? 
                         Well Tom, looks like the race to
                         partner has you in the rear.
                         Hell, Newman's probably working on
                         the appeals of those in purgatory
                         as we speak.

                                   JULIE
                         You know all about having a good
                         time, don't you?

                         stand and you tell me all about it.

                         You look white as a sheet, old

                         Either way, I'm not one to keep a
                         lady waiting.  Why don't you think

                         Remember that Miller fellow Adam

                         panicked call from Fell and he
                         mentioned Miller too... among other

                         paranoid.

                         I think I know the voice of a
                         senior partner at our firm, who is
                         north of sixty years old, from the
                         arrogant squawk of that douche bag.

                         Assuming it was Fell, maybe take a
                         sick day to drive into the desert

               Panel 5:

                                   WIGHT
                         Doubts I can stomach, so long as
                         the cup doesn't runneth over to
                         loyalty.  When somebody else is
                         sitting in this chair they can
                         change course as they deem fit. 
                         Until then...

                         That's why I like you, Howard. 
                         Succinct and to the point. I think
                         it's why you make a good attorney; 
                         No bullshit.

                         And it seems Tom Casey paid a visit
                         to Miller.  The stakes are raised
                         and it's your bet, Howard.

               Panel 6:

                                   WIGHT
                         In for a dime, in for a dollar.

                         Without Arthur it will be harder. 
                         But how does a God win back his
                         flock when they've seen the man
                         behind the curtain?

               Panel 1:

                                   ADAM (O.S.)
                         Ah, Tom... the prodigal son
                         returns.  Have a seat, stay a
                         while, huh?  Oh and as long as
                         you're here, how bout answering a
                         couple of questions such as...

               Panel 2:

                                   ADAM (CONT'D)
                         Where the hell were you today? 
                         Zoey said you had some business in
                         Barstow.
                         Seeing as how Bobby' Spire's case
                         has nothing to do with Barstow, I
                         assume it's personal business.

                                   TOM
                         That's right, it was personal.  How
                         bout we leave it at that.

               Panel 3:

                                   ADAM
                         Sure thing, pal.  Seems your lack
                         of professionalism was a leg up for
                         me.  Wight told me he was bringing
                         you in on Spire. But it seems I'm
                         his protege now. I know you'd kill
                         to be on that case.

                                   TOM
                         Let's just say my perspective has
                         changed since then.

                                   ADAM
                         Don't get in my way on Spire, his
                         acquittal is going to be a feather
                         in my cap, whether he did it or
                         not.  Got it?    

               Panel 4:

                                   TOM
                         Sure thing, asshole. 

               Panel 5:

                                   ADAM (O.S.)
                         Speaking of another score.  It's
                         Adam 1, Tom nil. But my guess is
                         you never even got up to bat with
                         her in the first place.
                         And trust me, Tom.  She's not as
                         innocent as she looks.
