Simple PHP Blog:
----------------

This is a modified version of the original SPHPBlog found at 
http://sourceforge.net/projects/sphpblog/

This version is Trackback (http://www.movabletype.org/trackback/beginners/) 
enabled.

WARNING: Make backup copies first!!
This stuff is not yet very well tested!! It works fine for me, but your mileage 
may vary.

When using this version with content created in the original version, run 
upgrade.php to move all comment*.txt to a comments/ subdirectory, where the new 
script expects them to be.
There is also a downgrade.php script to move the comments files back where the 
original scripts can find them. NOTE that this script also deletes all trackback
information!
